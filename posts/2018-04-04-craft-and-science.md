I recently came across [this post](https://medium.com/@sailorhg/art-and-math-and-science-oh-my-f1dc4ebb3223) from @sailorhg.  I've also had to struggle with reconciling my 'artistic' and 'rational' sides.  The idea that the intersection of Art plus Engineering is "Making Things" really resonates with me.  I never seriously tried to develop my artistic skills.  I was convinced that it would be futile because I had no inherent talent.  Instead, my talents were obviously with computers.  Never mind that I spent much of my childhood enjoying unstructured time on a computer instead of practicing for the piano, er-hu, and drawing lessons my parents wanted me to take.

Perhaps as a result, I gravitated towards activities I considered "craft" rather than "art".  It's easier to make the connection between 2-D art and 2-D digital mediums, like [this excellent concept of a project](http://vart.institute/matisse/index.html).  I've struggled to figure out how to easily tie in three dimensional crafts with 2-D digital mediums.

One idea was to form a MaptimeLA group that used map tiles to generate embroidery patterns.  Members would stitch each tile onto fabric (essentially a quilt square), adding their own landmarks to that geographical area.  The quilt squares would then be sewn together, creating our own community-generated representation of Los Angeles.  Deciding on standards was very off putting and ended up stalling the project for me.  I didn't know how to handle all the suggestions in a way that was collaborative but still maintained my vision.  I was also stuck on how to easily transfer the computer-generated patterns onto the fabric.  I'm still working it out because I want to bring back the project.  I've considered work on it solo as a prototype, and then bring the lessons learned into the group project.

I've wanted to create code a way to visually create pattern charts for knitting and crochet, but I think that would be beyond my ability to do on my own.

Using wool felt for UI design prototyping in a physical medium seems interesting.

What about teaching programming concepts using crafts?  Open cubes, made of crochet and easily attached to one another, could represent arrays.  This could work as a stop-motion video, or a fast motion video of the crafting process.  Is the process representative of the concept, or is it only the resulting pieces that are used to demonstrate the concept?

What concepts need simple explaining?  I think - the invisible things which we take for granted.  For the average person, there is no way to visualize how the internet works beneath the surface.

* How do browsers render webpages?
* How does HTTP work?
* How do web servers work?
* What happens when you navigate to a URL?
* How do load balancers work?
* What happens when code is compiled?

Writing these blog posts has become a nice way to take a break and brainstorm for ideas!
