**Goals for January**

2/6 - Learn to read Hiragana and Katakana.  Pretty much accomplished for basic Hiragana and Katakana!


**Habits for January**

1. Blog twice a week.
    * 6/25 - I kept up with this in the first part of the year but slowed down a bit in the past couple months.
2. Drink 96 fl.oz. of water per day.
    * 6/25 - I kept up with this goal as long as I was focused on this Goals page and tracking my progress.  I don't want to go down the goal-tracking app rabbit hole, so may try focusing on this again using post-it notes at work.
3. Floss daily.
    * 6/25 - Nothing.  Post-it notes again?
4. Do a daily workout from a 30-day fitness challenge.
    * 6/25 - Nada.  Perhaps too ambiguous of a goal with no clear benefits.  Maybe a physical goal like planking for x seconds, or doing x push-ups in a row is better?

## Future Goals

* Finish a Udemy course.
* Take violin lessons.
* Monthly craft project.
* Join a local non-profit or neighborhood group.
* App coding practice.
