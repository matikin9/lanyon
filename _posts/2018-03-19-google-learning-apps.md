Today I randomly came across 2 Google apps aimed at teaching Business/Marketing and Development skills.  Looks interesting so far, especially the UX design.

I spent the weekend re-listing To-Do items, and then I prioritized them.  I still haven't finished any of them.  I'd like to use this platform to create lists that I'd want to add to and reference in the future.  I realized that I don't tend to go back and reference things in my journal.  Not yet on my list of To-Dos, even though it should be, is re-formulating my goals list.

On the list of lists to create:
* Sellers of merchandise promoting tech, aimed at women.
* Ideas for civic tech merchandise.
* Books to read... Thinking Fast and Slow, Dan Ariely's books.
