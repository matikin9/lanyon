For the last two years, I've been toying with the idea of finding a Product Manager job.  It seems to fit with my current role at work, even if we don't distinguish ourselves with specific titles.  We're all "Systems Analysts", and some of us do "Development" while the others do "Business Analysis".  That's about as detailed as we get.

I went to one meetup event hosted by Product School, and I've been watching the video recording of the conference they hosted last week.  I've read a lot of articles, like this one about [product managers being the 'Jack of all Trades'](https://productcoalition.com/product-manager-jack-of-all-trades-ca72f75251cb0).  If I want to be serious about it, I need to figure out how to present myself, what skills I need to grow, and what kind of role I want.  This ties into potentially doing a side consulting gig too.  Do I focus on being the product manager or developer?
