It's practically the middle of March already, but I feel like I finally have a slight breather to get back on track with respect to goals.  Or I could be fooling myself, and the moment I start listing out all my upcoming plans I will melt in a puddle of overwhelmed-and-doesn't-want-to-do-anything-ness.  It's been 2 full weeks since my trip to Japan and I'm only just finishing up my journal entries about the trip.  I just finished a weekend of tabling and networking at SCaLE 16x.  

Goals need to be updated, for sure.  I just wrote out the things I need to take action on in March and there is TOO MUCH.

Not sure how to turn this into a goal, but Lawrence brought it to my attention that I should un-jargonize my language.  I agree.  I listen to myself speak sometimes, and I wonder at who this person is... throwing around these words.
