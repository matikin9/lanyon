"It's been busy" has been a common response every time someone asks me how I've been.  Since I last posted, I've been up in the Bay Area for 9 days.  The first weekend Lawrence and I stayed in Sunnyvale.  We slept and ate, and did barely anything else.  We watched AvengerS: Age of Ultron.  We had drinks and dinner with Megan & Zach.

The rest of the week was consumed by civic tech.  From the NAC in-person meeting day, to Brigade Day, to the two days of the Code for America Summit, to Saturday's bike ride with Hunter and two of his civic tech friends, and finally a car ride back to Los Angeles with Hunter and Vyki.

The 2 weeks after have been non-stop with work, introductions, meetings, and changes.  I'm feeling the creeping anxiety of recognizing that I'm hurtling forward like a train at full speed.  Too sharp of a curve in the tracks and I'll derail.  Writing here has been a good way to slow down and reflect.

As of today, I'm on a 30-day (maybe 60-day) keto diet plan.  I've felt rather dissatisfied with my physical state the past several months and Lawrence was willing to commit to prepping a meal plan for the both of us.  Today's lunch was a 500 calorie meal of chicken thigh and roasted cauliflower, topped with chili oil.  Dinner will be the same.  Tomorrow I'm supposed to skip food.  For this to work, I'll need to distract myself enough all day long so that I don't think about food.
