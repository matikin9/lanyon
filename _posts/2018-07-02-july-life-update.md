June and July are both turning out to be a non-stop meet and talk to people fest.  Today I had lunch with Kerry Silverstrom, Chief Deputy of LA County Beaches and Harbors.  She is one awesome lady and she keeps it so real.  Over the weekend, I saw Omar and Leigh, which was great... it's been a while since we last all got together.  We talked about project structures and being inspired by the Center for Urban Pedagogy.

I meant to write more, but work has been busy, renovating the house has been busy, and I need to prep for our July 4th BBQ, which is in 2 days.
