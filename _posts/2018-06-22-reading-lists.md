How do I aggregate and track my reading lists?!  I've got lists of books split up between my physical notebook, this blog, a Google Drive sheet, an Amazon wishlist, and my Goodreads account.  In addition, I've got online articles bookmarked through Twitter, Feedly, and Pocket.

The books span a variety of subjects: product management, leadership, communication, civic tech, behavioral economics, business, management, ethics, equality, entrepreneurialism, Lean, Agile, UX, writing, personal development, self-help, etc.

I'd like to be able to group them by subject(s), read status, priority, rating, etc.

It would be useful to track this information not just for myself, but so I can easily round up a list of recommended books for friends.
