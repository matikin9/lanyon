Video-freakin'-interview!  Wowowowoww.  Code for America is putting together a video interviewing people from brigades who have careers in public interest technology.  That includes government, and part of the focus is to show how helping the brigade network builds our digital capabilities within government.  Questions they're asking include:

* What do you do?
* What led you to working in Public Interest Tech?
* What has been the biggest challenge working in government?
* Tell me about the most rewarding experience you've had as a result of the work you're doing.
* Have you ever considered taknig your skills and experience to the private sector?  If so, why haven't you?
* What advice would you give to someone interested in working in Public Interest Tech?
* What's something that people don't know about your work?

That's a lot to think about and cover!  And this is the culmination of my week.  Since it's recorded, I think it will be a walk in the park compared to the other things I had going on.  Yesterday I was this month's Date + Donuts speaker, and it was my first time talking about a work project at an event open to the public.  Tuesday I had to give a presentation about the same project to another department who's interested in it.  That was a little easier to do because I've had more experience, but it's always a little nerve wracking not knowing if they're going to be hostile or friendly, or not knowing how skeptical they're going to be of your project.  After that I met with a member of Public Health's PLACE team who is working on a bunch of efforts for Vision Zero, Homelessness, and Sex Trafficking.  That turned out to be a great meeting and we're optimistic about collaborating in the future.

This weekend is already Mother's Day.  Next weekend we're going to the Renaissance Faire with Nikk and Traci.  The weekend after that is my trip to the Bay Area, continuing into the Code For America conference where I'm supposed to be on a panel (no further details yet!).
