I feel like I'm still catching up.  I've been in what feels like a permanent state of always catching up.  I tell myself, I just need some time to sit somewhere alone (a cafe, a bar, home) and do all the planning things.  Spending last weekend in Portland was a nice getaway.  I do feel a bit refreshed after that.  I worked hard (really!) to avoid catching up on work while on vacation.  Instead, I finished reading *To Sell is Human* by Daniel Pink, AND I picked up 5 more books to read.  I feel that I'm much more likely to finish reading a physical book than a digital one.

I've actually made it through my multiple huge lists of tasks - taking care of some items, dropping some items, and putting yet other items onto new short term/long term lists.

I haven't forgotten about goals.  We're quickly approaching the end of 2018 Q1, so this is a really good time to review those.
