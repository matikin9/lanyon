It's been an *emotional roller coaster* this past week - campaigning for NAC elections, preparing for Japan, Leonard moving away, talking about work with Omar, seeing my parents for the dual events of Chinese New Year and the 10-year anniversary of my grandfather's death.

I finally made it to Mortified, Leonard's show, and I saw him perform.  He was *awesome*.  My parents are actually fairly tolerable today.  I brought up Hack For LA and the NAC elections, and I think this time they finally tried to pay attention to what it was.  That's not totally fair of me, I'm sure they would have been more interested in the past if I were able to explain it to them in Chinese.

I freaked out the other night over preparing for Japan.  Lawrence calmed me down.  My list of what I *really* must do there:

* eat saucy tempura-don in Tokyo
* eat delicious tsukemen
* walk through a bamboo forest
* make my own custom journal at Kakimori and custom ink next door at Ink Stand (need a reservation)

I think that's it!  Everything else will be gravy.  Bowing deer in Nara, snow monkeys in hot springs in Nagano, street food in Osaka, Tsujiki Fish Market in Tokyo, geisha in Kyoto... all gravy.
