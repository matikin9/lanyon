I was at Blick's the other day.  It's like my candy store.  They've got art supplies, some crafting supplies, and a lot of the cute stationery store stuff that I love.  I picked up a box of Affirmation Cards, made by the awesome company, Knock Knock (makers of those hilarious checklist notepads).  More than cartomancy, I guess I just love the idea of randomly drawn cards that make you reflect.  These ones are great because they don't take themselves too seriously, even given their positive self-affirming messages.

Omar told me about a deck created by Brian Eno, called *Oblique Strategies*.  Its goal is to suggest different ways to think, in order to help you solve a problem.  Decks used to be hard to find because of its limited print runs.  It's now being printed in its 5th edition, but still costs over $50 - yikes!

**Message of the moment**

> **Courage** - No one is fearless.  No one.  But even though I'm not fearless, I *am* courageous.  When fear shows up, I don't run away from it.  I use my courage to conquer it.  My courage allows me to walk right up to that fear and kick it in the nuts - then quickly hide behind someone bigger until it goes away.
