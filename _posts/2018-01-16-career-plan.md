I remembered a moment from dinner with a friend last week.  She sent me info from her Harvard Business School mentor about figuring out your career priorities in order to plan out a career change.

Unfortunately the activity is behind a paywall, but the process of picking out values sounded familiar to me.  Lo and behold, I've done the exercise from [MindTools](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTED_85.htm).  Maybe it's time to do something similar again.  Google results showed this in depth list of analytical questions to [Develop a Strategic Vision For Your Career Plan](https://www.livecareer.com/career/advice/jobs/career-plan).
