Posting on a Sunday, wow!  I don't have any specific plans today, so I'm reflecting this morning before I jump on the PS4 to play Horizon.  I posted on my Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts that I'm running for NAC.  Still to do:

* post on Slack #general
* send out HFLA newsletter (elections, Leonard leaving, Civic Hacking 101)
* this week's NAC candidates forum

I got a nice outpouring of support on social media, which made me feel warm and fuzzy!  Saturday evening wasn't a particularly prime time to post but I'm okay with that.

I'm continuing to lose weight throughout the week.  Yesterday morning I reached 171 lbs, which is my lowest point so far.  That jumped up to 172 lbs this morning, which is not suprising because I had breaded fried food and beer yesterday.  Eating more vegetables/fiber is still a struggle because of the prep.  It's easy to buy and eat ready to go proteins and fatty foods.

In terms of goals... reaching February and still thinking about goals is already a pretty good place for me.  I've got the rest of the year to actually try to follow through on goals.  I know where my weaknesses are.  In a perfect world, I'd have daily routines and each goal would have its own time slot.  In reality, life is unpredictable and unexpected things happen - which is great!  I don't WANT a predictable routine life without spontaneity.  It does make sticking to several goals difficult.  Like trying to form multiple habits at once is a bad idea, I do think I have too many goals going right now.  My goal to read a book each month took a nosedive in priority once I started playing Horizon.  Playing through Horizon essentially became my "want" goal over my "should" goal of reading.

I stopped practicing Japanese daily also.  I felt I reached a reasonable point in being able to read hiragana and katakana, and so the urgency decreased.  I tried to add in stretch goals of reading basic kanji, increasing vocabulary, and learning basic sentence structures but those were unfeasible to learn by the time of our trip.  What I need to do is prep for place to visit, things to eat, activities to do!  In just barely over a week, I'm going to be IN JAPAN!
