Last weekend was MaptimeLA's second camping trip.  We took a boat from Ventura to Santa Cruz Island, one of the five islands that make up Channel Islands National Park.  I didn't do much research heading in so I didn't know what to expect, except that there were specific rules on what could be brought on the boat and to the island.

Turns out it was much more relaxed and built out than we expected!  You can rent snorkeling and kayaking gear on the island.  People do day trips.  The camp sites are a short trek away on a flat dirt road - individual sites are .3 miles in and the group sites are another .3 miles further.  The campsites have potable water spigots, well maintained pit toilets that have toilet paper, toilet seat covers, AND hand sanitizer!  They're kept shady by the many large eucalyptus trees that are found just at the campgrounds.  The one thing to watch out for is the wildlife - ravens and foxes will steal food if you don't keep it secured in the fox boxes.  We saw it happen several times and if the rangers catch you being careless you'll get fined.  Several trails start in the area, but they all go up and there is no shade cover so be careful hiking on hot days.

Our boat ride on Friday was very choppy because of a coastal storm somewhere.  We passed by a huge traveling pod of dolphins!  We did an evening hike up to Potato Harbor, which was wonderfully windy as we walked along the bluffs.  Over the next two days, the wind died down severely and it was much hotter.  The others attempted to hike, but I chose to stay in the shade at the campground - which was conveniently still breezy.  I was intent on enjoying myself by having a relaxing weekend enjoying the nature and remoteness by knitting, crocheting, and reading.  Mission accomplished for me.  For food, I stuck to my diet by snacking on the variety of low carb cheese breads, pesto, nuts, salami, jerky, and bacon.

It was such a great relaxing weekend and it was so much fun to watch the baby foxes play.  I'd love to go back!
