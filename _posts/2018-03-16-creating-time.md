Half a year ago I moved back into DTLA.  For 2 years before that I was living in Covina, commuting to DTLA daily AND on the weekends.  I never spent time at home, and so one of my goals in moving back to DTLA was to make home a space I wanted to be in and to actually spend time there.  I've been able to accomplish that, which is great.  However, what I've realized is that I constantly find myself unable to put my head down and do work because home is so comfy and distracting.  In the past, I was forced to do work (or at least crafting) because I had nothing to do while sitting in cafes.

Lately I find that I am creating lists, mentally noting that I need to set aside time to sit down and work on the things on my lists.  I think I can do it at home, but I get distracted hanging out with Lawrence and Amy.  I love spending time with them, but I don't like spending that time feeling like I really should be doing something else.  The other thing impacting this is that I've been a lot busier at work the past year.  More assignments, more meetings, etc.  So I have less time during the day to set aside to plan my time.

A schedule will be good, if I can stick to it.  :D  Saturday morning.  Tuesday afternoon.  GOALS.
