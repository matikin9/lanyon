I've read in a book about stress, that an effective way to combat the anxiety you feel before a task is to tell yourself the physical symptoms you feel are due to excitement instead.

I've also read that the best way to grow is to put yourself in situations outside your comfort zone and I've been doing a lot of that in the last several years.  I used to say 'Yes' to things without any consideration for a long term strategy/goal.  Now, I've learned to say 'No' to some things but also to say 'Yes' to the the things that help me grow.

I still feel the anxiety every time, but with a few experiences under my belt I can now tell myself that it will turn out fine.  I've been able to speak in front of an audience without making a total fool of myself.  I can do it again!
