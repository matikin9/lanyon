I think the last time I ran for anything was high school Winter Formal Queen, and you get nominated for that.  No, I did not win and I was perfectly fine with it.  Perhaps in an effort to protect my ego, I don't place any expectation on my ability to ever win an election.  Running for the CFA Brigade NAC is a tiny bit different.  I had a few people asking me if I was planning to run (and then telling me they thought I should).  Someone took the step of nominating me.  A few friends noticed my name in the list of candidates and wished me luck.  A few friends publicly posted endorsements of me on social media.  All this was so much more support than I could dare to hope for in this capacity.  It means a great deal to me that these friends went out of their way to vocalize their support to me personally and publicly on the internet.

I still have yet to make a public announcement for myself on my social media accounts.  I don't want to screw it up by not knowing what I'm doing and saying the wrong thing.  But I can't let my friends' support go to waste because of my own low self esteem and insecurities.  If they have confidence in my ability after knowing me and interacting with me, who am I to tell them their opinion is wrong?  It helps that in the last several years, I've strived to present myself more openly and authentically to the people around me.  I used to dismiss others' positive opinions of me with the excuse that they didn't really know me.  I could only use that as an excuse if I thought I wasn't presenting myself the way I saw myself.  I've improved a lot on that front!  Blah blah blah, stupid overly-critical self-analysis... thinking myself into circular thoughts...

## So why AM I running?

It's not because I think I'm the best for the job.  Plenty of people know more about tech, public policy, government, community organizing, etc. than I do.  The other candidates are people I look up to!  I see it as an opportunity for me to make my contribution to something I'm passionate about.  And what is it exactly that I'm passionate about?  Civic tech, local communities, government, all that - yes.  But more than that, empowering individuals; creating work that has value; building relationships that turn into a community.  I want to do all of this, in the context of civic tech, local communities, and government.

I still struggle with social anxiety and imposter syndrome.  I started attending local tech meetup 3 years ago and the community was small and close-knit enough that I now know several of the community leaders.  Because of their encouragement and my enthusiasm for the work they do, I soon took on leadership roles.  I've been part of Hack for LA leadership since late 2015, and while the exact date is a little fuzzy, I've been a co-captain for about 2 of those years.

Leading a community has been a constant learning experience from day one.  My degree is in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, from UC Berkeley.  Almost immediately after graduating, I went into a local government as a systems analyst / fullstack web developer / business analyst.  Most of my career has been spent in my cubicle in front of a computer screen and forcing myself to socialize with strangers was one of the most nervewracking things I ever put myself through.  Then as co-captain, I had to get up and speak in front of strangers!  Now I can say it was worth all the initial stress.  I love developing relationships and connecting people.  Even when there is dissatisfaction and drama within the community, I feel compelled to embrace the situation and help resolve the conflicts.  I won't have all the answers, but I'm committed to giving it my all.

What do I want to accomplish?  For me it's all about community.  I believe in the power of a group of people with common goals to accomplish great things.  By building a talented, supportive community, we can harness a power that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Through my experience as a co-captain, I see that this is something we still lack.  I want to improve the bonds between brigades so that we can learn from each other, collaborate on projects, and spread what works.  I want each brigade member to feel included, like this is a place for them and they are part of a larger community that shares their values.  It's as simple as that.  I'm not running on a complex platform of solutions to address all the issues brigades encounter.  For me, focusing on the community is the priority.  No community = no efficacy.
