I recently came across [this post](https://medium.com/@sailorhg/art-and-math-and-science-oh-my-f1dc4ebb3223) from @sailorhg, which I really like and also find adorable (in the best way).  I've similarly had to struggle with reconciling my 'artistic' and 'rational' sides.  The idea that "Making Things" is the intersection of Art and Engineering resonates with me strongly.  I never seriously tried to develop my artistic skills.  I was convinced that it would be futile because I had no inherent talent.  I took piano, er-hu, and drawing lessons but found it frustrating.  My body didn't seem to want to consistently produce a result that was up to my standards.  Instead, I spent my time coding in HTML or digitally editing images in Paint Shop Pro.

Ultimately, I gravitated towards activities I considered "craft" rather than "art".  I've seen many projects that make the connection between 2-D art and 2-D digital mediums, like [this excellent concept of a project](http://vart.institute/matisse/index.html).  I've struggled to figure out how to incorporate 3-D crafts like sewing, knitting, etc.

One idea I had a couple years ago was to use stylized map tiles to generate simple embroidery patterns.  As a MaptimeLA project, members would stitch each tile's features onto fabric (essentially a quilt square), and then add their own landmarks to that geographical area.  The quilt squares would then be sewn together, thus creating our own community-generated representation of Los Angeles.  Deciding on standards for the common features was very off-putting and ended up stalling the project.  I didn't know how to handle all the suggestions in a way that was collaborative but still maintained my vision.  I was also stuck on the technical aspect of how to easily transfer the computer-generated patterns onto the fabric.  I'm still working it out because I want to bring back the project.  I've considered starting on it solo as a prototype, but I worry that doing this is just a way for me to avoid facing difficult things!

I've wanted to create an app that lets me visually create pattern charts for knitting and crochet, but I think that would be beyond my ability to do on my own.  It's not the coding logic, but the graphical representation that I don't feel up to.

Using wool felt for UI design prototyping in a physical medium seems interesting.

Is there a way I can teaching programming concepts using crafts?  Arrays versus dictionaries, objects, classes, functions.  This could work as a stop-motion video, or a fast motion video of the crafting process.  Is the process representative of the concept, or is it only the resulting pieces that are used to demonstrate the concept?

What concepts need simple explaining?  I think - the invisible things which we take for granted.  For the average person, there is no way to visualize how the internet works beneath the surface.

* How do browsers render webpages?
* How does HTTP work?
* How do web servers work?
* What happens when you navigate to a URL?
* How do load balancers work?
* What happens when code is compiled?

Writing these blog posts has become a nice way to take a break and brainstorm for ideas!
