Last night I went to my first technical learning Meetup event in a longgg time.  It was the monthly Vue.js meetup, held in DTLA at Amanda McGlothlin's space, Headquarters.  Both Jon Jandoc and Jon Kim presented, and then Jim was there too!  So it was a nice impromptu Hack For LA reunion.  I learned a LOT:

* I don't need to feel guilty for not learning Angular and React.  I can skip those and go straight to Vue.
* Vue + Nuxt + Netlify makes for a cool deployment stack.
* Cypress.io is a cool Selenium replacement for Vue.
* I've been a big proponent of [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) without realizing someone had created a name for it - client-side Javascript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.
* It's been a long time since I've done real coding.
* Jim is interested in working with me on doing a project startup guide.
* VS Code is now a popular code editor.
