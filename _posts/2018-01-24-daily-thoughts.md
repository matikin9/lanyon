This is turning into a daily posting. :)  Which is great!  I saw an inspirational journal spread on instagram that defined a "daily rhythm".  I like that description.  Routine has such a negative connotation, and rhythm implies structure with room for flexibility.  Here's what I've got so far:

* Get out of bed by 7:30 am
  * shower
  * make coffee
  * make breakfast
* Leave home by 8:30 am
* Prep for bed by 10:00 pm
  * brush teeth
  * floss
  * clean & moisturize face (maybe mask)
* In bed by 11:00 pm

Muffin peed on the bed again this morning.  It was completely my fault.  I haven't been cleaning out the litter box regularly, even after the previous 2 times she peed on the bed.  Even last night, I had the thought in my head that I should clean the litter box... but I ignored it.  This has been an unfortunate pattern.  As much as I have negative voices in my head that amplify my insecurities, I also have good voices that I should be listening to.  I often ignore them due to laziness, or telling myself it will be okay.  So many times, I regret not having followed my gut.  What will it take for me to pay attention?

I'm overhwelming myself again with choices in tools.  I've expanded into to-do list apps to manage daily goals as a checklist.  The problem is the tool itself will not help with motivating me to actually do the habits, so it doesn't matter which tool I use.  I need something simple enough that it doesn't take much setup time, and doesn't allow me to complicate things too much.
