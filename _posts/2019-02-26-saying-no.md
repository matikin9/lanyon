It's almost March of 2019 already, and the last time I wrote a post was in July 2018.  So much has been happening, I wish I had documented it better.

2019 is looking to be even crazier and I expect to get a lot of practice saying 'No' this year.  I thought it'd be a good idea to document that... as well as the things I'm saying 'Yes' to.

## Events / New Commitments in 2019
